without registering or login user will be directed to the login page , if the user is not
registered with the application then user can simply sign up by the signup link provided 
at the end of login page . Sign up requires first name , last name , username , email and 
password , user got errors once they try to sign up with already existing email, 
email format issues and fail to follow password requirement. after succusfull login user

players based on the longest rush longest rushing touchdowns and total rushing yards
